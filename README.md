# classifying-and-clustering-the-newsgroups
I leveraged an algorithmic approach for document classification and document clustering. Various models have been trained for document classification and they all have been evaluated using performance metrics followed by tuning of the model hyper-parameters to reach the most accurate classification. Additionally, a model has been trained for document clustering, which is followed by a dimensionality reduction technique to visualize the document clusters in 2D space.
